# GistHub API - Summarization Backend

Welcome to the **GistHub API**! This is the backend part of the GistHub webapp that powers the summarization feature using Facebook's BART model from Hugging Face. ðŸŽ‰

## Requirements

- **Python version**: 3.13.0 (for the closest match to the development environment, use this version).
- **Virtual Environment (venv)**: Highly recommended to keep your dependencies isolated and your life less chaotic.
  
### 1. **Set Up Your Python Environment**

To ensure you're using the correct Python version and dependencies, we recommend setting up a **virtual environment**. This will help you avoid version conflicts with other Python projects.

#### Install Python 3.13.0
If you don't already have Python 3.13.0 installed, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-1310/).

#### Create a Virtual Environment

Run the following commands to create and activate your virtual environment.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd GistHub_API

# Create a virtual environment
python3.13 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once you're in your virtual environment, you'll see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line, indicating you're in the right environment.

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python dependencies by running:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary packages for running the API, including Flask and Hugging Face's `transformers` library.

### 3. **Run the API**

Once everything is set up, you can run the Flask backend API. 

```bash
# Run the Flask API
python app.py
```

By default, the API will run on `http://localhost:5000`. You can test it using a tool like **Postman** or **curl**, or by making requests from the frontend of the app.

### 4. **Testing the API**

To test the summarization feature, you can send a POST request to the `/api/summarize` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "payload": "Your text to be summarized goes here."
}
```

You'll get a summary response with the text you provided.

### 5. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**

Once you're done, don't forget to deactivate your virtual environment:

```bash
# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

This will return you to the global environment.

## Notes:

- **Python Version**: For best results, use Python 3.13.0, the version used in development.
- **Virtual Environment**: It's strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects. If you're new to virtual environments, check out the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
